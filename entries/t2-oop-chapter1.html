          <br>
          <h3 class="subheading">Requirements and specification</h3>
          <p align="justify">The book defines three main factors we must understand in order to determine the best course of action for any given solution: 
            The <b>problem</b> itself, the <b>business environment</b>, and the <b>available technlogy</b>. The general process includes following activities:</p>
            <h5>Domain analysis</h5>
              <p align="justify">This refers to what is known as <a style="color:#42D5EC;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge" target="_blank">Domain Knowledge</a>
              This is the process in which we investigate common features between all the products and parts of the system, in order to discover potentially reusable designs. 
              This is often learned from a user in the domain, an expert or specialist, rather than the software developers.</p>
            <h5>Defining the problem</h5>
            <p align="justify">One of the most important parts of understanding the problem, it's definining the <a style="color:#42D5EC;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)" target="_blank">Scope</a> 
              of the system. In simple words, this determines what is and what is NOT part of the features and functionalities the system must provide.</p>
            <h5>Requirements gathering</h5>
            <p align="justify">The process in which we obtain all the functional and non-functional requirements, everything the system is expected to do. 
               This usually involves a middle man between the development team and the client. In Agile Methodologies, such as
               <a style="color:#42D5EC;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)" target="_blank">Scrum</a>, 
               a Product Owner is in charge of gathering the requeriments for the project.</p>
            <h5>Requirements analysis</h5>
            <p align="justify"> Once we have gathered the requirements, we must organize them, and plan an action plan on how to execute the solution. 
                This usually involves a discussion between the PO and the Development Team.
            <h5>Requirements specification</h5>
            <p align="justify"> One of the most important documents in every project. The specification will precisely point out every functionality or feature of the system.
              Both the "whats" (what is needed to solve the problem) and the "hows" (the desing and implementation). It's important to point out that this is bound to change, 
              so requirement analysis should continue throughout the life of a software system.
          <h3 class="subheading">Design</h3>
          <p align="justify">

              Design is the process of deciding how the requirements should be implemented using the available technology. This often involved the use of well defined and documented
              <a style="color:#42D5EC;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>, among them, Creational, Sctructural, Behavioral and Concurrency Patterns.
              This design should always be defined to comply with several aspects of a system, to name a few:
              <ul>
                  <li>Compatibility</li>
                  <li>Extensibility</li>
                  <li>Fault-tolerance</li>
                  <li>Maintainability</li>
                  <li>Reliability</li>
                  <li>Reusability</li>
                  <li>Performance</li>
                  <li>Portability</li>
                  <li>Scalability</li>
                </ul>
          </p>
          <h3 class="subheading">Modeling</h3>
          <p align="justify">Modeling is the process of creating a representation of the domain or the software. 
             Software modeling should address the entire software design including interfaces, interactions with other software, and all the software methods. The book mentions a few approaches:
            <ul>
                <li>Use Case modeling: Actions performed by users.</li>
                <li>Structural modeling: Classes and objects.</li>
                <li>Dynamic and behavioral modeling: States, activities and component interaction.</li>
              </ul>
              For object-oriented software, an object modeling language such as <a style="color:#42D5EC;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_LanguageUML" target="_blank">UML</a> is often used. 
          </p>
          <h3 class="subheading">Programming</h3>
          <p align="justify">So we have our specification, we've defined our design. It's time to execute. This means, translating those higher-level designs into particular programming languages. 
            This requires knowledge of a particular programming language, in order to make decisions about the appropriate use of constructs, variable declarations, etc. which language to use varies from project
            to project. <b>C#, Java, Node and Python</b>, are common choices for Back-End and Middle-Tier development; <b>JavaScript, TypeScript, Swift, and PHP</b> are some popular options for Front-End.
          </p>
          <p align="justify">Now, when it comes to the methodologies for programming, the team must decide on which one suits best their expertise and level of communication. The book mentions 
              <a style="color:#42D5EC;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming" target="_blank">Extreme Programming (XP)</a>, though I would argue this methodology is a bit outdated and newer
              and more efective ones have emerged in the recent years. As mentioned before, Scrum is a very popular choice, along with Kanban, or even a combination of both. 
              A very promising option gaining lots of popularity in recent years is <a style="color:#42D5EC;" href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank">SAFe</a>.
            </p>
          <h3 class="subheading">Quality assurance</h3>
          <p align="justify">When it comes to delivering software, quality is key. It's not only about delivering a working product, but one that complies with all of the aspects previously 
            mentioned in the design section. In order to achieve this, we must do several activities, usually "tests", to verify and validate that our system works as expected. To mention a few:</p>
            Functional tests:
            <ul>
                <li>Unit testing</li>
                <li>Integration testing</li>
                <li>System testing</li>
                <li>Sanity testing</li>
                <li>Smoke testing</li>
                <li>Interface testing</li>
                <li>Regression testing</li>
                <li>Beta/Acceptance testing</li>
                <li>Scalability</li>
              </ul>

            Non-functional testing types include:
            <ul>
                <li>Performance Testing</li>
                <li>Load testing</li>
                <li>Stress testing</li>
                <li>Volume testing</li>
                <li>Security testing</li>
                <li>Reliability testing</li>
                <li>Usability testing</li>
                <li>Beta/Acceptance testing</li>
                <li>Scalability</li>
              </ul>
          <h3 class="subheading">Deployment</h3>
          <p align="justify">Finally, once our system is complete, it's time to deploy it. This is, release it into a public environment where the user can access and use it. In recent years, 
            the concepts of <a style="color:#42D5EC;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank">Continuous Integration</a> and
            <a style="color:#42D5EC;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery" target="_blank">Continuous Delivery</a> have been vital to the succesful deployment of software in an
            automated environment. Allowing the team to build, test, and release software with greater speed and frequency.
